### GUI's
- [gitk](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1570535/guide-to-understanding-gitk) Comes with git.  You will use this a lot. [Good intro here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1570535/guide-to-understanding-gitk).
- [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html): Commercial, All Platforms
- [GitX](http://github.com/downloads/brotherbard/gitx/GitX%207-5-2010.zip): OSX only
- [gitg](http://github.com/jessevdk/gitg): GNOME/gtk+ clone of GitX
- [git-cola](http://cola.tuxfamily.org/): Really powerful, Linux only
- [qgit](http://digilander.libero.it/mcostalba/): QT based, All Platforms
- [TortoiseGit](http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/) Just like TortoiseSVN, Windows

## Bash Aliases
Copy and paste the below into your shell.

    cd ~/ && git clone git://gist.github.com/114160.git .githelper && echo "# Add me to your .profile or .bash_profile.  Save the file, open a new terminal, and you'll have all of this." && echo "" && echo "source ~/.githelper/gistfile1.sh"

Some of the helpers this bash script adds:

- freebase, f: Fetch and rebase the current branch (update)
- commit, c: Create a new commit of all changes files (git commit -a)
- push, p: push local commits to the remote repository
- whatamipushing: opens gitk. the green rectangle with your branch name is where you are.  The orange and green rectangle is where the remote is.
- remotediff: fetch and open gitk.  The green rectangle with your branch name is where you are.  The orange and green rectangle is where the remote is.

## Diff tool
There are too many of these to list. [Meld](http://meld.sourceforge.net) is great for unix.  [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/) for OSX if you dont mind paying (free trial).

## Day to day
- `freebase` to get any changes
    - Got conflicts?  
         - `git rebase --abort && git pull;`
    - Still have conflicts? 
         - Resolve them in each file
         - Run `git add <file-path>` for each file that was in conflict
         - `git commit` to commit the resolved conflict state
         - `git push` to push the changes to the remote.
    - No conflict?
         - You win.
         - Almost always the case when several people aren't making big changes to the same code.
- Do work.
- `git add <path>` to add new files
- `git commit` to save state locally
- `freebase` to make sure nothing has changed on the remote before we push
- `git push` to send your changes to the remote

## Rebasing vs pulling

## Merging

Resolving merge conflicts:

- Files in conflict after a merge will be shown by `git status` in red and listed as both modified.
- Resolve the conflicts in each file
- Run `git add <file-path>` for each file that was in conflict
- `git commit` to commit the resolved conflict state
- `git push` to push the changes to the remote.



## Synchronize View
- `git fetch && gitk --all &`
- `git fetch && gitx`
- SmartGit: `git fetch` then `Query -> Log` from the file menu

## Bash Aliases
Copy and paste the below into your shell.

    cd ~/ && git clone git://gist.github.com/114160.git .githelper && echo "# Add me to your .profile or .bash_profile.  Save the file, open a new terminal, and you'll have all of this." && echo "" && echo "source ~/.githelper/gistfile1.sh"
